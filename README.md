Hi, this Repository Call Exactusindicina.
Exactus means exact in Latin worrds, and Indicina means information as Latin words.
Therefore, this repository try to give you exact information.

The definition of exact means "Completely Correct in every detail"
Also, definition of information means "facts or details that tell you something about a situation, person, event etc"

However, I understand linguistic definition often changes through times, place, race, species, aims, depending on their own identities, etc.

As a result, this repository will contain and will be built based on my objective aims, situations, identities, etc. 

Therefore, I would recommend you, if the information on this repository does not fit to you and not perfectly matches up with your aims, situation, or identities, etc. just let this repository be like this.

Only if you need some part of datas or peice of datas in thie repository, you can use through learning and reading. 

As I mentioned above, linguistic definition often changes through times, place, race, species, aims, depending on their own identities, etc.
Therefore, if you are not comfortable and stisfied with information or regarding this repository, please just walk away. 
As I said, something can be changed in time frame. So, I would recommend you to use "time frame" without saying something bad about this repository. 

let me explain a bit regarding this "time frame".
just as the planet called earth exists on the time frame, this virtual repository also on the time frame.
So, please avoid quantum entanglement which is not necessary by just walking away. 

Also, I do not know what to call this virtual somehting built on the web or internet, but I pretty sure that you can find nearly most of information that you need for your own something that often called times, place, race, species, aims, depending on their own identities, etc. 

(I think I seems little corrections in the last page, but I need time a bit more. not today.)
